here I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.	train	catcher
In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages	train	catcher
apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.	train	catcher
They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father.	train	catcher
They're nice and all	train	catcher
--I'm not saying that--but they're also touchy as hell.	train	catcher
Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything.	train	catcher
I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy.	train	catcher
I mean that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all.	train	catcher
He's in Hollywood.	train	catcher
That isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end.	train	catcher
He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe.	train	catcher
He just got a Jaguar.	train	catcher
One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour.	train	catcher
It cost him damn near four thousand bucks.	train	catcher
He's got a lot of dough, now.	train	catcher
He didn't use to.	train	catcher
He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home.	train	catcher
He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him.	train	catcher
The best one in it was The Secret Goldfish.	train	catcher
It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money.	train	catcher
It killed me.	train	catcher
Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute.	train	catcher
If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies.	train	catcher
Don't even mention them to me.	train	catcher
school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania.	train	catcher
You probably heard of it.	train	catcher
You've probably seen the ads, anyway.	train	catcher
They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence.	train	catcher
Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time.	train	catcher
I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place.	train	catcher
And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.	train	catcher
Strictly for the birds.	train	catcher
They don't do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school.	train	catcher
And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all.	train	catcher
Maybe two guys.	train	catcher
If that many.	train	catcher
And they probably came to Pencey that way.	train	catcher
with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey.	train	catcher
It was the last game	train	catcher
Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall.	train	catcher
The game Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep.	train	catcher
Pencey Prep is this There were never many girls at all at the football games.	train	catcher
Only seniors were I forgot to tell you about that.	train	catcher
They kicked me out.	train	catcher
I wasn't supposed to come The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win.	train	catcher
I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all.	train	catcher
You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place.	train	catcher
You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.	train	catcher
allowed to bring girls with them.	train	catcher
It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it.	train	catcher
I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something.	train	catcher
Old Selma Thurmer--she was the headmaster's daughter--showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire.	train	catcher
She was a pretty nice girl, though.	train	catcher
I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation.	train	catcher
I liked her.	train	catcher
She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking	train	catcher
and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but	train	catcher
you felt sort of sorry for her.	train	catcher
What I liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was.	train	catcher
She probably knew what a phony slob he was.	train	catcher
was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team.	train	catcher
I was the goddam manager of the fencing team.	train	catcher
Very big deal.	train	catcher
We'd gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School.	train	catcher
Only, we didn't have the meet.	train	catcher
I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway.	train	catcher
It wasn't all my fault.	train	catcher
I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off.	train	catcher
So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime.	train	catcher
The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train.	train	catcher
It was pretty funny, in a way.	train	catcher
The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher.	train	catcher
He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started.	train	catcher
He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home.	train	catcher
He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey.	train	catcher
back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all.	train	catcher
They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself--especially around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer--but I didn't do it.	train	catcher
So I got the ax.	train	catcher
They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey.	train	catcher
It has a very good academic rating, Pencey.	train	catcher
It really does.	train	catcher
Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on top of that stupid hill.	train	catcher
I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything.	train	catcher
The week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur- lined gloves right in the pocket and all.	train	catcher
Pencey was full of crooks.	train	catcher
Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway.	train	catcher
The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has--I'm not kidding.	train	catcher
Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off.	train	catcher
Only, I wasn't watching the game too much.	train	catcher
What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind	train	catcher
Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204.	train	catcher
It was icy as hell of a good-by.	train	catcher
I mean I've left schools and places	train	catcher
I didn't even know I was leaving them.	train	catcher
I hate that.	train	catcher
I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it.	train	catcher
If you don't, you feel even worse.	train	catcher
I was lucky.	train	catcher
All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out.	train	catcher
I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building.	train	catcher
They were nice guys, especially Tichener.	train	catcher
It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway.	train	catcher
It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want to stop doing what we were doing.	train	catcher
Finally we had to.	train	catcher
This teacher that taught biology, Mr. Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner.	train	catcher
If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one--	train	catcher
at least, most of the time I can.	train	catcher
As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer's house.	train	catcher
He didn't live on the campus.	train	catcher
He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.	train	catcher
I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath.	train	catcher
I have no wind, if you want to know the truth.	train	catcher
I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing--that is, I used to be.	train	catcher
They made me cut it out.	train	catcher
Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year.	train	catcher
That's also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff.	train	catcher
I'm pretty healthy, though.	train	catcher
and I damn near fell down.	train	catcher
I don't even know what I was running for--I guess I just felt like it.	train	catcher
After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing.	train	catcher
It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.	train	catcher
frozen.	train	catcher
My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all.	train	catcher
C'mon, c'mon	train	catcher
, I said right out loud, almost, somebody open the door.	train	catcher
Finally old Mrs. Spencer opened.	train	catcher
it.	train	catcher
They didn't have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door themselves.	train	catcher
They didn't have too much dough.	train	catcher
Holden!	train	catcher
Mrs. Spencer said.	train	catcher
How lovely to see you!	train	catcher
Come in, dear!	train	catcher
Are you frozen to death?	train	catcher
I think she was glad to see me.	train	catcher
She liked me.	train	catcher
At least, I think she did.	train	catcher
Spencer?	train	catcher
Spencer was.	train	catcher
She was sort of deaf.	train	catcher
She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand.	train	catcher
I wear a crew cut quite frequently	train	catcher
and I never have to comb it much.	train	catcher
How've you been, Mrs. Spencer?	train	catcher
I said again, only louder, so she'd hear me.	train	catcher
The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer'd told her I'd been kicked out.	train	catcher
room, dear.	train	catcher
Go right in.	train	catcher
Fine, I said.	train	catcher
How's Mr. Spencer?	train	catcher
He over his grippe yet?	train	catcher
Over it!	train	catcher
Holden, he's behaving like a perfect--I don't know what. . .	train	catcher
He's in his Boy	train	catcher
, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer's house.	train	catcher
I was really Boy, did I get in that house fast.	train	catcher
How are you, Mrs. Spencer?	train	catcher
I said.	train	catcher
How's	train	catcher
Mr. Let me take your coat, dear, she said.	train	catcher
She didn't hear me ask her how Mr. I've been just fine, Holden.	train	catcher
She closed the closet door.	train	catcher
How have you been?	train	catcher
They each had their own room and all.	train	catcher
They were both around seventy years old, 2 or even more than that.	train	catcher
They got a bang out of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of course.	train	catcher
I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean.	train	catcher
I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for.	train	catcher
I mean he was all stooped over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him.	train	catcher
That's awful, in my opinion.	train	catcher
But if you thought about him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for himself.	train	catcher
For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park.	train	catcher
You could tell old Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it.	train	catcher
That's what I mean.	train	catcher
You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket.	train	catcher
could see where he was sitting.	train	catcher
He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in that blanket	train	catcher
I just told you about.	train	catcher
He looked over at me when I knocked.	train	catcher
Who's that?	train	catcher
he yelled.	train	catcher
Caulfield?	train	catcher
Come in, boy.	train	catcher
He was always yelling, outside class.	train	catcher
It got on your nerves sometimes.	train	catcher
The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come.	train	catcher
He was reading the Atlantic Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops.	train	catcher
It was pretty depressing.	train	catcher
I'm not too crazy about sick people, anyway.	train	catcher
What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something.	train	catcher
I don't much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway.	train	catcher
Their bumpy old chests are always showing.	train	catcher
And their legs.	train	catcher
Old guys' legs, at beaches and places, always look so white and unhairy.	train	catcher
Hello, sir, I said.	train	catcher
I got your note.	train	catcher
Thanks a lot.	train	catcher
He'd written me this note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account of I wasn't coming back.	train	catcher
You didn't have to do all that.	train	catcher
I'd have come over to say good-by anyway.	train	catcher
knocked him out.	train	catcher
He started chuckling like a madman.	train	catcher
Then he finally straightened himself out and said, Why aren't you down at the game?	train	catcher
I thought this was the day of the big game.	train	catcher
Boy, his bed was like a rock.	train	catcher
said.	train	catcher
Yes, sir.	train	catcher
I guess I am.	train	catcher
He started going into this nodding routine.	train	catcher
You never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old Spencer did.	train	catcher
You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn't know his ass from his elbow.	train	catcher
Have a seat there, boy, old Spencer said.	train	catcher
He meant the bed.	train	catcher
I sat down on it.	train	catcher
How's your grippe, sir?	train	catcher
M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor, old Spencer said.	train	catcher
That His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all.	train	catcher
I It is.	train	catcher
I was.	train	catcher
Only, I just got back from New York with the fencing team, I said.	train	catcher
He started getting serious as hell.	train	catcher
I knew he would.	train	catcher
So you're leaving us, eh?	train	catcher
he	train	catcher
He said he was going to write them Monday.	train	catcher
Have you yourself communicated with them?	train	catcher
No, sir, I haven't communicated with them, because I'll probably see them	train	catcher
And how do you think they'll take the news?	train	catcher
Well. . .	train	catcher
they'll be pretty irritated about it, I said.	train	catcher
They really will.	train	catcher
This is about Life is a game, boy.	train	catcher
Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.	train	catcher
Yes, sir.	train	catcher
I know it is.	train	catcher
I know it.	train	catcher
Game, my ass.	train	catcher
Some game.	train	catcher
If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then What did Dr. Thurmer say to you, boy?	train	catcher
I understand you had quite a little chat.	train	catcher
Yes, we did.	train	catcher
We really did.	train	catcher
I was in his office for around two hours, I guess.	train	catcher
What'd he say to you?	train	catcher
Romeo and Juliet	train	romeo-juliet
Act 2, Scene 2 	train	romeo-juliet
SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.	train	romeo-juliet
Enter ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET appears above at a window	train	romeo-juliet
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?	train	romeo-juliet
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.	train	romeo-juliet
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,	train	romeo-juliet
Who is already sick and pale with grief,	train	romeo-juliet
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:	train	romeo-juliet
Be not her maid, since she is envious;	train	romeo-juliet
Her vestal livery is but sick and green	train	romeo-juliet
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.	train	romeo-juliet
It is my lady, O, it is my love!	train	romeo-juliet
O, that she knew she were!	train	romeo-juliet
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?	train	romeo-juliet
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.	train	romeo-juliet
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:	train	romeo-juliet
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,	train	romeo-juliet
Having some business, do entreat her eyes	train	romeo-juliet
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	train	romeo-juliet
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?	train	romeo-juliet
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,	train	romeo-juliet
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven	train	romeo-juliet
Would through the airy region stream so bright	train	romeo-juliet
That birds would sing and think it were not night.	train	romeo-juliet
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!	train	romeo-juliet
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,	train	romeo-juliet
That I might touch that cheek!	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
Ay me!	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
She speaks:	train	romeo-juliet
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art	train	romeo-juliet
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head	train	romeo-juliet
As is a winged messenger of heaven	train	romeo-juliet
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes	train	romeo-juliet
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him	train	romeo-juliet
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds	train	romeo-juliet
And sails upon the bosom of the air.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?	train	romeo-juliet
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;	train	romeo-juliet
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,	train	romeo-juliet
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;	train	romeo-juliet
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.	train	romeo-juliet
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,	train	romeo-juliet
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part	train	romeo-juliet
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!	train	romeo-juliet
What's in a name? that which we call a rose	train	romeo-juliet
By any other name would smell as sweet;	train	romeo-juliet
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,	train	romeo-juliet
Retain that dear perfection which he owes	train	romeo-juliet
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,	train	romeo-juliet
And for that name which is no part of thee	train	romeo-juliet
Take all myself.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
I take thee at thy word:	train	romeo-juliet
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;	train	romeo-juliet
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night	train	romeo-juliet
So stumblest on my counsel?	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
By a name	train	romeo-juliet
I know not how to tell thee who I am:	train	romeo-juliet
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,	train	romeo-juliet
Because it is an enemy to thee;	train	romeo-juliet
Had I it written, I would tear the word.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words	train	romeo-juliet
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:	train	romeo-juliet
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?	train	romeo-juliet
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,	train	romeo-juliet
And the place death, considering who thou art,	train	romeo-juliet
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;	train	romeo-juliet
For stony limits cannot hold love out,	train	romeo-juliet
And what love can do that dares love attempt;	train	romeo-juliet
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye	train	romeo-juliet
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,	train	romeo-juliet
And I am proof against their enmity.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
I would not for the world they saw thee here.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;	train	romeo-juliet
And but thou love me, let them find me here:	train	romeo-juliet
My life were better ended by their hate,	train	romeo-juliet
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;	train	romeo-juliet
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.	train	romeo-juliet
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far	train	romeo-juliet
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,	train	romeo-juliet
I would adventure for such merchandise.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,	train	romeo-juliet
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek	train	romeo-juliet
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night	train	romeo-juliet
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny	train	romeo-juliet
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!	train	romeo-juliet
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'	train	romeo-juliet
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,	train	romeo-juliet
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries	train	romeo-juliet
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,	train	romeo-juliet
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:	train	romeo-juliet
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,	train	romeo-juliet
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,	train	romeo-juliet
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.	train	romeo-juliet
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,	train	romeo-juliet
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:	train	romeo-juliet
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true	train	romeo-juliet
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.	train	romeo-juliet
I should have been more strange, I must confess,	train	romeo-juliet
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,	train	romeo-juliet
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,	train	romeo-juliet
And not impute this yielding to light love,	train	romeo-juliet
Which the dark night hath so discovered.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear	train	romeo-juliet
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,	train	romeo-juliet
That monthly changes in her circled orb,	train	romeo-juliet
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
What shall I swear by?	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
Do not swear at all;	train	romeo-juliet
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,	train	romeo-juliet
Which is the god of my idolatry,	train	romeo-juliet
And I'll believe thee.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
If my heart's dear love--	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,	train	romeo-juliet
I have no joy of this contract to-night:	train	romeo-juliet
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;	train	romeo-juliet
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be	train	romeo-juliet
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!	train	romeo-juliet
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,	train	romeo-juliet
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	train	romeo-juliet
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest	train	romeo-juliet
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:	train	romeo-juliet
And yet I would it were to give again.	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?	train	romeo-juliet
JULIET	train	romeo-juliet
But to be frank, and give it thee again.	train	romeo-juliet
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:	train	romeo-juliet
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,	train	romeo-juliet
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,	train	romeo-juliet
The more I have, for both are infinite.	train	romeo-juliet
Nurse calls within	train	romeo-juliet
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!	train	romeo-juliet
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.	train	romeo-juliet
Stay but a little, I will come again.	train	romeo-juliet
Exit, above	train	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	train	romeo-juliet
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.	train	romeo-juliet
Being in night, all this is but a dream,	train	romeo-juliet

Exit	train	romeo-juliet
here I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.	test	catcher
In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages	test	catcher
apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.	test	catcher
They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father.	test	catcher
They're nice and all	test	catcher
--I'm not saying that--but they're also touchy as hell.	test	catcher
Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything.	test	catcher
I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy.	test	catcher
I mean that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all.	test	catcher
He's in Hollywood.	test	catcher
That isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end.	test	catcher
He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe.	test	catcher
He just got a Jaguar.	test	catcher
One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour.	test	catcher
It cost him damn near four thousand bucks.	test	catcher
He's got a lot of dough, now.	test	catcher
He didn't use to.	test	catcher
He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home.	test	catcher
He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him.	test	catcher
The best one in it was The Secret Goldfish.	test	catcher
It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money.	test	catcher
It killed me.	test	catcher
Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute.	test	catcher
If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies.	test	catcher
Don't even mention them to me.	test	catcher
school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania.	test	catcher
You probably heard of it.	test	catcher
You've probably seen the ads, anyway.	test	catcher
They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence.	test	catcher
Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time.	test	catcher
I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place.	test	catcher
And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.	test	catcher
Strictly for the birds.	test	catcher
They don't do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school.	test	catcher
And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all.	test	catcher
Maybe two guys.	test	catcher
If that many.	test	catcher
And they probably came to Pencey that way.	test	catcher
with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey.	test	catcher
It was the last game	test	catcher
Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall.	test	catcher
The game Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep.	test	catcher
Pencey Prep is this There were never many girls at all at the football games.	test	catcher
Only seniors were I forgot to tell you about that.	test	catcher
They kicked me out.	test	catcher
I wasn't supposed to come The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win.	test	catcher
I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all.	test	catcher
You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place.	test	catcher
You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.	test	catcher
allowed to bring girls with them.	test	catcher
It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it.	test	catcher
I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something.	test	catcher
Old Selma Thurmer--she was the headmaster's daughter--showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire.	test	catcher
She was a pretty nice girl, though.	test	catcher
I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation.	test	catcher
I liked her.	test	catcher
She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking	test	catcher
and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but	test	catcher
you felt sort of sorry for her.	test	catcher
What I liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was.	test	catcher
She probably knew what a phony slob he was.	test	catcher
was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team.	test	catcher
I was the goddam manager of the fencing team.	test	catcher
Very big deal.	test	catcher
We'd gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School.	test	catcher
Only, we didn't have the meet.	test	catcher
I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway.	test	catcher
It wasn't all my fault.	test	catcher
I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off.	test	catcher
So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime.	test	catcher
The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the test.	test	catcher
It was pretty funny, in a way.	test	catcher
The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher.	test	catcher
He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started.	test	catcher
He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home.	test	catcher
He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey.	test	catcher
back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all.	test	catcher
They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself--especially around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer--but I didn't do it.	test	catcher
So I got the ax.	test	catcher
They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey.	test	catcher
It has a very good academic rating, Pencey.	test	catcher
It really does.	test	catcher
Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on top of that stupid hill.	test	catcher
I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything.	test	catcher
The week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur- lined gloves right in the pocket and all.	test	catcher
Pencey was full of crooks.	test	catcher
Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway.	test	catcher
The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has--I'm not kidding.	test	catcher
Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off.	test	catcher
Only, I wasn't watching the game too much.	test	catcher
What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind	test	catcher
Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204.	test	catcher
It was icy as hell of a good-by.	test	catcher
I mean I've left schools and places	test	catcher
I didn't even know I was leaving them.	test	catcher
I hate that.	test	catcher
I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it.	test	catcher
If you don't, you feel even worse.	test	catcher
I was lucky.	test	catcher
All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out.	test	catcher
I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building.	test	catcher
They were nice guys, especially Tichener.	test	catcher
It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway.	test	catcher
It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want to stop doing what we were doing.	test	catcher
Finally we had to.	test	catcher
This teacher that taught biology, Mr. Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner.	test	catcher
If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one--	test	catcher
at least, most of the time I can.	test	catcher
As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer's house.	test	catcher
He didn't live on the campus.	test	catcher
He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.	test	catcher
I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath.	test	catcher
I have no wind, if you want to know the truth.	test	catcher
I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing--that is, I used to be.	test	catcher
They made me cut it out.	test	catcher
Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year.	test	catcher
That's also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff.	test	catcher
I'm pretty healthy, though.	test	catcher
and I damn near fell down.	test	catcher
I don't even know what I was running for--I guess I just felt like it.	test	catcher
After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing.	test	catcher
It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.	test	catcher
frozen.	test	catcher
My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all.	test	catcher
C'mon, c'mon	test	catcher
, I said right out loud, almost, somebody open the door.	test	catcher
Finally old Mrs. Spencer opened.	test	catcher
it.	test	catcher
They didn't have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door themselves.	test	catcher
They didn't have too much dough.	test	catcher
Holden!	test	catcher
Mrs. Spencer said.	test	catcher
How lovely to see you!	test	catcher
Come in, dear!	test	catcher
Are you frozen to death?	test	catcher
I think she was glad to see me.	test	catcher
She liked me.	test	catcher
At least, I think she did.	test	catcher
Spencer?	test	catcher
Spencer was.	test	catcher
She was sort of deaf.	test	catcher
She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand.	test	catcher
I wear a crew cut quite frequently	test	catcher
and I never have to comb it much.	test	catcher
How've you been, Mrs. Spencer?	test	catcher
I said again, only louder, so she'd hear me.	test	catcher
The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer'd told her I'd been kicked out.	test	catcher
room, dear.	test	catcher
Go right in.	test	catcher
Fine, I said.	test	catcher
How's Mr. Spencer?	test	catcher
He over his grippe yet?	test	catcher
Over it!	test	catcher
Holden, he's behaving like a perfect--I don't know what. . .	test	catcher
He's in his Boy	test	catcher
, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer's house.	test	catcher
I was really Boy, did I get in that house fast.	test	catcher
How are you, Mrs. Spencer?	test	catcher
I said.	test	catcher
How's	test	catcher
Mr. Let me take your coat, dear, she said.	test	catcher
She didn't hear me ask her how Mr. I've been just fine, Holden.	test	catcher
She closed the closet door.	test	catcher
How have you been?	test	catcher
They each had their own room and all.	test	catcher
They were both around seventy years old, 2 or even more than that.	test	catcher
They got a bang out of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of course.	test	catcher
I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean.	test	catcher
I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for.	test	catcher
I mean he was all stooped over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him.	test	catcher
That's awful, in my opinion.	test	catcher
But if you thought about him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for himself.	test	catcher
For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park.	test	catcher
You could tell old Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it.	test	catcher
That's what I mean.	test	catcher
You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket.	test	catcher
could see where he was sitting.	test	catcher
He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in that blanket	test	catcher
I just told you about.	test	catcher
He looked over at me when I knocked.	test	catcher
Who's that?	test	catcher
he yelled.	test	catcher
Caulfield?	test	catcher
Come in, boy.	test	catcher
He was always yelling, outside class.	test	catcher
It got on your nerves sometimes.	test	catcher
The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come.	test	catcher
He was reading the Atlantic Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops.	test	catcher
It was pretty depressing.	test	catcher
I'm not too crazy about sick people, anyway.	test	catcher
What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something.	test	catcher
I don't much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway.	test	catcher
Their bumpy old chests are always showing.	test	catcher
And their legs.	test	catcher
Old guys' legs, at beaches and places, always look so white and unhairy.	test	catcher
Hello, sir, I said.	test	catcher
I got your note.	test	catcher
Thanks a lot.	test	catcher
He'd written me this note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account of I wasn't coming back.	test	catcher
You didn't have to do all that.	test	catcher
I'd have come over to say good-by anyway.	test	catcher
knocked him out.	test	catcher
He started chuckling like a madman.	test	catcher
Then he finally straightened himself out and said, Why aren't you down at the game?	test	catcher
I thought this was the day of the big game.	test	catcher
Boy, his bed was like a rock.	test	catcher
said.	test	catcher
Yes, sir.	test	catcher
I guess I am.	test	catcher
He started going into this nodding routine.	test	catcher
You never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old Spencer did.	test	catcher
You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn't know his ass from his elbow.	test	catcher
Have a seat there, boy, old Spencer said.	test	catcher
He meant the bed.	test	catcher
I sat down on it.	test	catcher
How's your grippe, sir?	test	catcher
M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor, old Spencer said.	test	catcher
That His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all.	test	catcher
I It is.	test	catcher
I was.	test	catcher
Only, I just got back from New York with the fencing team, I said.	test	catcher
He started getting serious as hell.	test	catcher
I knew he would.	test	catcher
So you're leaving us, eh?	test	catcher
he	test	catcher
He said he was going to write them Monday.	test	catcher
Have you yourself communicated with them?	test	catcher
No, sir, I haven't communicated with them, because I'll probably see them	test	catcher
And how do you think they'll take the news?	test	catcher
Well. . .	test	catcher
they'll be pretty irritated about it, I said.	test	catcher
They really will.	test	catcher
This is about Life is a game, boy.	test	catcher
Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.	test	catcher
Yes, sir.	test	catcher
I know it is.	test	catcher
I know it.	test	catcher
Game, my ass.	test	catcher
Some game.	test	catcher
If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then What did Dr. Thurmer say to you, boy?	test	catcher
I understand you had quite a little chat.	test	catcher
Yes, we did.	test	catcher
We really did.	test	catcher
I was in his office for around two hours, I guess.	test	catcher
What'd he say to you?	test	catcher

ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET appears above at a window	test	romeo-juliet
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?	test	romeo-juliet
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.	test	romeo-juliet
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,	test	romeo-juliet
Who is already sick and pale with grief,	test	romeo-juliet
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:	test	romeo-juliet
Be not her maid, since she is envious;	test	romeo-juliet
Her vestal livery is but sick and green	test	romeo-juliet
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.	test	romeo-juliet
It is my lady, O, it is my love!	test	romeo-juliet
O, that she knew she were!	test	romeo-juliet
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?	test	romeo-juliet
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.	test	romeo-juliet
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:	test	romeo-juliet
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,	test	romeo-juliet
Having some business, do entreat her eyes	test	romeo-juliet
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	test	romeo-juliet
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?	test	romeo-juliet
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,	test	romeo-juliet
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven	test	romeo-juliet
Would through the airy region stream so bright	test	romeo-juliet
That birds would sing and think it were not night.	test	romeo-juliet
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!	test	romeo-juliet
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,	test	romeo-juliet
That I might touch that cheek!	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
Ay me!	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
She speaks:	test	romeo-juliet
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art	test	romeo-juliet
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head	test	romeo-juliet
As is a winged messenger of heaven	test	romeo-juliet
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes	test	romeo-juliet
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him	test	romeo-juliet
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds	test	romeo-juliet
And sails upon the bosom of the air.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?	test	romeo-juliet
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;	test	romeo-juliet
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,	test	romeo-juliet
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;	test	romeo-juliet
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.	test	romeo-juliet
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,	test	romeo-juliet
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part	test	romeo-juliet
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!	test	romeo-juliet
What's in a name? that which we call a rose	test	romeo-juliet
By any other name would smell as sweet;	test	romeo-juliet
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,	test	romeo-juliet
Retain that dear perfection which he owes	test	romeo-juliet
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,	test	romeo-juliet
And for that name which is no part of thee	test	romeo-juliet
Take all myself.	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
I take thee at thy word:	test	romeo-juliet
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;	test	romeo-juliet
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night	test	romeo-juliet
So stumblest on my counsel?	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
By a name	test	romeo-juliet
I know not how to tell thee who I am:	test	romeo-juliet
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,	test	romeo-juliet
Because it is an enemy to thee;	test	romeo-juliet
Had I it written, I would tear the word.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words	test	romeo-juliet
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:	test	romeo-juliet
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?	test	romeo-juliet
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,	test	romeo-juliet
And the place death, considering who thou art,	test	romeo-juliet
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;	test	romeo-juliet
For stony limits cannot hold love out,	test	romeo-juliet
And what love can do that dares love attempt;	test	romeo-juliet
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye	test	romeo-juliet
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,	test	romeo-juliet
And I am proof against their enmity.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
I would not for the world they saw thee here.	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;	test	romeo-juliet
And but thou love me, let them find me here:	test	romeo-juliet
My life were better ended by their hate,	test	romeo-juliet
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;	test	romeo-juliet
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.	test	romeo-juliet

JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,	test	romeo-juliet
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek	test	romeo-juliet
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night	test	romeo-juliet
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny	test	romeo-juliet
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!	test	romeo-juliet
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'	test	romeo-juliet
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,	test	romeo-juliet
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries	test	romeo-juliet
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,	test	romeo-juliet
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:	test	romeo-juliet
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,	test	romeo-juliet
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,	test	romeo-juliet
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.	test	romeo-juliet
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,	test	romeo-juliet
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:	test	romeo-juliet
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true	test	romeo-juliet
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.	test	romeo-juliet
I should have been more strange, I must confess,	test	romeo-juliet
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,	test	romeo-juliet
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,	test	romeo-juliet
And not impute this yielding to light love,	test	romeo-juliet
Which the dark night hath so discovered.	test	romeo-juliet

If my heart's dear love--	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,	test	romeo-juliet

It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;	test	romeo-juliet
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be	test	romeo-juliet
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!	test	romeo-juliet
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,	test	romeo-juliet
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	test	romeo-juliet

What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:	test	romeo-juliet
And yet I would it were to give again.	test	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	test	romeo-juliet
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?	test	romeo-juliet
JULIET	test	romeo-juliet
But to be frank, and give it thee again.	test	romeo-juliet
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:	test	romeo-juliet
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,	test	romeo-juliet
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,	test	romeo-juliet
The more I have, for both are infinite.	test	romeo-juliet

Exit	test	romeo-juliet
here I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.	val	catcher
In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages	val	catcher
apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.	val	catcher
They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father.	val	catcher
They're nice and all	val	catcher
--I'm not saying that--but they're also touchy as hell.	val	catcher
Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything.	val	catcher
I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy.	val	catcher
I mean that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all.	val	catcher
He's in Hollywood.	val	catcher
That isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end.	val	catcher
He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe.	val	catcher
He just got a Jaguar.	val	catcher
One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour.	val	catcher
It cost him damn near four thousand bucks.	val	catcher
He's got a lot of dough, now.	val	catcher
He didn't use to.	val	catcher
He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home.	val	catcher
He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him.	val	catcher
The best one in it was The Secret Goldfish.	val	catcher
It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money.	val	catcher
It killed me.	val	catcher
Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute.	val	catcher
If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies.	val	catcher
Don't even mention them to me.	val	catcher
school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania.	val	catcher
You probably heard of it.	val	catcher
You've probably seen the ads, anyway.	val	catcher
They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence.	val	catcher
Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time.	val	catcher
I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place.	val	catcher
And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.	val	catcher
Strictly for the birds.	val	catcher
They don't do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school.	val	catcher
And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all.	val	catcher
Maybe two guys.	val	catcher
If that many.	val	catcher
And they probably came to Pencey that way.	val	catcher
with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey.	val	catcher
It was the last game	val	catcher
Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall.	val	catcher
The game Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep.	val	catcher
Pencey Prep is this There were never many girls at all at the football games.	val	catcher
Only seniors were I forgot to tell you about that.	val	catcher
They kicked me out.	val	catcher
I wasn't supposed to come The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win.	val	catcher
I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all.	val	catcher
You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place.	val	catcher
You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.	val	catcher
allowed to bring girls with them.	val	catcher
It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it.	val	catcher
I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something.	val	catcher
Old Selma Thurmer--she was the headmaster's daughter--showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire.	val	catcher
She was a pretty nice girl, though.	val	catcher
I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation.	val	catcher
I liked her.	val	catcher
She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking	val	catcher
and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but	val	catcher
you felt sort of sorry for her.	val	catcher
What I liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was.	val	catcher
She probably knew what a phony slob he was.	val	catcher
was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team.	val	catcher
I was the goddam manager of the fencing team.	val	catcher
Very big deal.	val	catcher
We'd gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School.	val	catcher
Only, we didn't have the meet.	val	catcher
I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway.	val	catcher
It wasn't all my fault.	val	catcher
I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off.	val	catcher
So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime.	val	catcher
The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the val.	val	catcher
It was pretty funny, in a way.	val	catcher
The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher.	val	catcher
He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started.	val	catcher
He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home.	val	catcher
He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey.	val	catcher
back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all.	val	catcher
They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself--especially around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer--but I didn't do it.	val	catcher
So I got the ax.	val	catcher
They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey.	val	catcher
It has a very good academic rating, Pencey.	val	catcher
It really does.	val	catcher
Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on top of that stupid hill.	val	catcher
I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything.	val	catcher
The week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur- lined gloves right in the pocket and all.	val	catcher
Pencey was full of crooks.	val	catcher
Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway.	val	catcher
The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has--I'm not kidding.	val	catcher
Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off.	val	catcher
Only, I wasn't watching the game too much.	val	catcher
What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind	val	catcher
Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204.	val	catcher
It was icy as hell of a good-by.	val	catcher
I mean I've left schools and places	val	catcher
I didn't even know I was leaving them.	val	catcher
I hate that.	val	catcher
I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it.	val	catcher
If you don't, you feel even worse.	val	catcher
I was lucky.	val	catcher
All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out.	val	catcher
I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building.	val	catcher
They were nice guys, especially Tichener.	val	catcher
It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway.	val	catcher
It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want to stop doing what we were doing.	val	catcher
Finally we had to.	val	catcher
This teacher that taught biology, Mr. Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner.	val	catcher
If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one--	val	catcher
at least, most of the time I can.	val	catcher
As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer's house.	val	catcher
He didn't live on the campus.	val	catcher
He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.	val	catcher
I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath.	val	catcher
I have no wind, if you want to know the truth.	val	catcher
I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing--that is, I used to be.	val	catcher
They made me cut it out.	val	catcher
Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year.	val	catcher
That's also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff.	val	catcher
I'm pretty healthy, though.	val	catcher
and I damn near fell down.	val	catcher
I don't even know what I was running for--I guess I just felt like it.	val	catcher
After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing.	val	catcher
It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.	val	catcher
frozen.	val	catcher
My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all.	val	catcher
C'mon, c'mon	val	catcher
, I said right out loud, almost, somebody open the door.	val	catcher
Finally old Mrs. Spencer opened.	val	catcher
it.	val	catcher
They didn't have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door themselves.	val	catcher
They didn't have too much dough.	val	catcher
Holden!	val	catcher
Mrs. Spencer said.	val	catcher
How lovely to see you!	val	catcher
Come in, dear!	val	catcher
Are you frozen to death?	val	catcher
I think she was glad to see me.	val	catcher
She liked me.	val	catcher
At least, I think she did.	val	catcher
Spencer?	val	catcher
Spencer was.	val	catcher
She was sort of deaf.	val	catcher
She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand.	val	catcher
I wear a crew cut quite frequently	val	catcher
and I never have to comb it much.	val	catcher
How've you been, Mrs. Spencer?	val	catcher
I said again, only louder, so she'd hear me.	val	catcher
The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer'd told her I'd been kicked out.	val	catcher
room, dear.	val	catcher
Go right in.	val	catcher
Fine, I said.	val	catcher
How's Mr. Spencer?	val	catcher
He over his grippe yet?	val	catcher
Over it!	val	catcher
Holden, he's behaving like a perfect--I don't know what. . .	val	catcher
He's in his Boy	val	catcher
, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer's house.	val	catcher
I was really Boy, did I get in that house fast.	val	catcher
How are you, Mrs. Spencer?	val	catcher
I said.	val	catcher
How's	val	catcher
Mr. Let me take your coat, dear, she said.	val	catcher
She didn't hear me ask her how Mr. I've been just fine, Holden.	val	catcher
She closed the closet door.	val	catcher
How have you been?	val	catcher
They each had their own room and all.	val	catcher
They were both around seventy years old, 2 or even more than that.	val	catcher
They got a bang out of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of course.	val	catcher
I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean.	val	catcher
I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for.	val	catcher
I mean he was all stooped over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him.	val	catcher
That's awful, in my opinion.	val	catcher
But if you thought about him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for himself.	val	catcher
For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park.	val	catcher
You could tell old Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it.	val	catcher
That's what I mean.	val	catcher
You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket.	val	catcher
could see where he was sitting.	val	catcher
He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in that blanket	val	catcher
I just told you about.	val	catcher
He looked over at me when I knocked.	val	catcher
Who's that?	val	catcher
he yelled.	val	catcher
Caulfield?	val	catcher
Come in, boy.	val	catcher
He was always yelling, outside class.	val	catcher
It got on your nerves sometimes.	val	catcher
The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come.	val	catcher
He was reading the Atlantic Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops.	val	catcher
It was pretty depressing.	val	catcher
I'm not too crazy about sick people, anyway.	val	catcher
What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something.	val	catcher
I don't much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway.	val	catcher
Their bumpy old chests are always showing.	val	catcher
And their legs.	val	catcher
Old guys' legs, at beaches and places, always look so white and unhairy.	val	catcher
Hello, sir, I said.	val	catcher
I got your note.	val	catcher
Thanks a lot.	val	catcher
He'd written me this note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account of I wasn't coming back.	val	catcher
You didn't have to do all that.	val	catcher
I'd have come over to say good-by anyway.	val	catcher
knocked him out.	val	catcher
He started chuckling like a madman.	val	catcher
Then he finally straightened himself out and said, Why aren't you down at the game?	val	catcher
I thought this was the day of the big game.	val	catcher
Boy, his bed was like a rock.	val	catcher
said.	val	catcher
Yes, sir.	val	catcher
I guess I am.	val	catcher
He started going into this nodding routine.	val	catcher
You never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old Spencer did.	val	catcher
You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn't know his ass from his elbow.	val	catcher
Have a seat there, boy, old Spencer said.	val	catcher
He meant the bed.	val	catcher
I sat down on it.	val	catcher
How's your grippe, sir?	val	catcher
M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor, old Spencer said.	val	catcher
That His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all.	val	catcher
I It is.	val	catcher
I was.	val	catcher
Only, I just got back from New York with the fencing team, I said.	val	catcher
He started getting serious as hell.	val	catcher
I knew he would.	val	catcher
So you're leaving us, eh?	val	catcher
he	val	catcher
He said he was going to write them Monday.	val	catcher
Have you yourself communicated with them?	val	catcher
No, sir, I haven't communicated with them, because I'll probably see them	val	catcher
And how do you think they'll take the news?	val	catcher
Well. . .	val	catcher
they'll be pretty irritated about it, I said.	val	catcher
They really will.	val	catcher
This is about Life is a game, boy.	val	catcher
Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.	val	catcher
Yes, sir.	val	catcher
I know it is.	val	catcher
I know it.	val	catcher
Game, my ass.	val	catcher
Some game.	val	catcher
If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then What did Dr. Thurmer say to you, boy?	val	catcher
I understand you had quite a little chat.	val	catcher
Yes, we did.	val	catcher
We really did.	val	catcher
I was in his office for around two hours, I guess.	val	catcher
What'd he say to you?	val	catcher

Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,	val	romeo-juliet
Having some business, do entreat her eyes	val	romeo-juliet
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	val	romeo-juliet
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?	val	romeo-juliet
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,	val	romeo-juliet
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven	val	romeo-juliet
Would through the airy region stream so bright	val	romeo-juliet

Ay me!	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
She speaks:	val	romeo-juliet
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art	val	romeo-juliet
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head	val	romeo-juliet
As is a winged messenger of heaven	val	romeo-juliet
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes	val	romeo-juliet
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him	val	romeo-juliet
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds	val	romeo-juliet
And sails upon the bosom of the air.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?	val	romeo-juliet
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;	val	romeo-juliet
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,	val	romeo-juliet
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;	val	romeo-juliet
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.	val	romeo-juliet
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,	val	romeo-juliet
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part	val	romeo-juliet
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!	val	romeo-juliet
What's in a name? that which we call a rose	val	romeo-juliet
By any other name would smell as sweet;	val	romeo-juliet
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,	val	romeo-juliet
Retain that dear perfection which he owes	val	romeo-juliet
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,	val	romeo-juliet
And for that name which is no part of thee	val	romeo-juliet
Take all myself.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
I take thee at thy word:	val	romeo-juliet
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;	val	romeo-juliet
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night	val	romeo-juliet
So stumblest on my counsel?	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
By a name	val	romeo-juliet
I know not how to tell thee who I am:	val	romeo-juliet
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,	val	romeo-juliet
Because it is an enemy to thee;	val	romeo-juliet
Had I it written, I would tear the word.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words	val	romeo-juliet
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:	val	romeo-juliet
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?	val	romeo-juliet
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,	val	romeo-juliet
And the place death, considering who thou art,	val	romeo-juliet
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;	val	romeo-juliet
For stony limits cannot hold love out,	val	romeo-juliet
And what love can do that dares love attempt;	val	romeo-juliet
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye	val	romeo-juliet
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,	val	romeo-juliet
And I am proof against their enmity.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
I would not for the world they saw thee here.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;	val	romeo-juliet
And but thou love me, let them find me here:	val	romeo-juliet
My life were better ended by their hate,	val	romeo-juliet
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;	val	romeo-juliet
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.	val	romeo-juliet
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far	val	romeo-juliet
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,	val	romeo-juliet
I would adventure for such merchandise.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,	val	romeo-juliet
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek	val	romeo-juliet
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night	val	romeo-juliet
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny	val	romeo-juliet
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!	val	romeo-juliet
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'	val	romeo-juliet
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,	val	romeo-juliet
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries	val	romeo-juliet
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,	val	romeo-juliet
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:	val	romeo-juliet
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,	val	romeo-juliet
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,	val	romeo-juliet
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.	val	romeo-juliet
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,	val	romeo-juliet
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:	val	romeo-juliet
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true	val	romeo-juliet
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.	val	romeo-juliet
I should have been more strange, I must confess,	val	romeo-juliet
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,	val	romeo-juliet
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,	val	romeo-juliet
And not impute this yielding to light love,	val	romeo-juliet
Which the dark night hath so discovered.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear	val	romeo-juliet
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,	val	romeo-juliet
That monthly changes in her circled orb,	val	romeo-juliet
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
What shall I swear by?	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
Do not swear at all;	val	romeo-juliet
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,	val	romeo-juliet
Which is the god of my idolatry,	val	romeo-juliet
And I'll believe thee.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
If my heart's dear love--	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,	val	romeo-juliet
I have no joy of this contract to-night:	val	romeo-juliet
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;	val	romeo-juliet
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be	val	romeo-juliet
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!	val	romeo-juliet
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,	val	romeo-juliet
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	val	romeo-juliet
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest	val	romeo-juliet
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:	val	romeo-juliet
And yet I would it were to give again.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
But to be frank, and give it thee again.	val	romeo-juliet
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:	val	romeo-juliet
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,	val	romeo-juliet
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,	val	romeo-juliet
The more I have, for both are infinite.	val	romeo-juliet
Nurse calls within	val	romeo-juliet
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!	val	romeo-juliet
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.	val	romeo-juliet
Stay but a little, I will come again.	val	romeo-juliet
Exit, above	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.	val	romeo-juliet
Being in night, all this is but a dream,	val	romeo-juliet
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.	val	romeo-juliet
Re-enter JULIET, above	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.	val	romeo-juliet
If that thy bent of love be honourable,	val	romeo-juliet
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,	val	romeo-juliet
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,	val	romeo-juliet
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;	val	romeo-juliet
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay	val	romeo-juliet
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.	val	romeo-juliet
Nurse	val	romeo-juliet
[Within] Madam!	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,	val	romeo-juliet
I do beseech thee--	val	romeo-juliet
Nurse	val	romeo-juliet
[Within] Madam!	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
By and by, I come:--	val	romeo-juliet
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:	val	romeo-juliet
To-morrow will I send.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
So thrive my soul--	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
A thousand times good night!	val	romeo-juliet
Exit, above	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.	val	romeo-juliet
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from	val	romeo-juliet
their books,	val	romeo-juliet
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.	val	romeo-juliet
Retiring	val	romeo-juliet
Re-enter JULIET, above	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,	val	romeo-juliet
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!	val	romeo-juliet
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;	val	romeo-juliet
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,	val	romeo-juliet
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,	val	romeo-juliet
With repetition of my Romeo's name.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
It is my soul that calls upon my name:	val	romeo-juliet
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,	val	romeo-juliet
Like softest music to attending ears!	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
Romeo!	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
My dear?	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
At what o'clock to-morrow	val	romeo-juliet
Shall I send to thee?	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
At the hour of nine.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.	val	romeo-juliet
I have forgot why I did call thee back.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
Let me stand here till thou remember it.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,	val	romeo-juliet
Remembering how I love thy company.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,	val	romeo-juliet
Forgetting any other home but this.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:	val	romeo-juliet
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;	val	romeo-juliet
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,	val	romeo-juliet
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,	val	romeo-juliet
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,	val	romeo-juliet
So loving-jealous of his liberty.	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
I would I were thy bird.	val	romeo-juliet
JULIET	val	romeo-juliet
Sweet, so would I:	val	romeo-juliet
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.	val	romeo-juliet
Good night, good night! parting is such	val	romeo-juliet
sweet sorrow,	val	romeo-juliet
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.	val	romeo-juliet
Exit above	val	romeo-juliet
ROMEO	val	romeo-juliet
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!	val	romeo-juliet
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!	val	romeo-juliet
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,	val	romeo-juliet
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.	val	romeo-juliet
Exit	val	romeo-juliet
